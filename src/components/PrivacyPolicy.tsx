              This policy explains how we collect and use personal data when you
              visit [kreatix.tld] (the “Website”), contact us, become a client,
              or use services we provide (design, development, hosting/reseller,
              maintenance, support). It also explains when we act as data
              processor for our clients.

              2) Roles: Controller vs Processor
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We act as Controller for data we collect about Website visitors,
                prospective clients, clients and their contacts, and
                billing/admin contacts.
              </li>
              <li>
                We act as Processor when clients engage us to process data on
                their behalf (e.g., site analytics, forms, hosting, CDNs, email
                delivery). In those cases, a Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
                applies, and the client is the Controller. Our standard DPA is
                available on request at [privacy@yourdomain].
